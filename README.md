# Earthquake_Prediction
Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of its devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be. I will address when the earthquake will take place. specifically, Iâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data. If this problem is solved and the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure.
